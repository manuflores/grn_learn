# Code

This folder contains all of the jupyter notebooks for all of the analyses of the paper. 

It contains two subdirectories `analysis` and `exploratory`. In the `analysis` folder, as it names suggests, you can find the main scripts for the core pipeline of the paper. In the `exploratory` folder, we added all of the jupyter notebooks used as part of the process of developing the analysis.
